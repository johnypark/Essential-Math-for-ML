# Essential-Math-for-ML
Repo for essential mathematics of statistical learning methods.

Goes down to probability theory, numerical analysis, linear algebra, and statistics and explain the connections of those subjects in the methods.  


1. Approximating relationship of data
 	- Ordinary least squared methods for getting the best approximation onto vector space (Vector space, inner product, linear independence, basis expansion (multiple linear regression being same as higher polynomial approximation), QR decomposition, rank, column space, norm, partial derivative, guassian distribution, maximum liklihood estimation, log liklihood) 
	- Non-parametric estimation: LOESS regression

2. Validating the approximation 
	 -Training and testing data for robust prediction 
	 -Cross-validation (using cross validation for ordinary least squares)
	 -Model selection (AIC, AICC, BIC)


3. Cost function and distance
	-RMSE and gaussian distribution
	-MAE and laplace distribution
	-Euclidean distance
	-Manaholobis distance


4. Dimensionality reduction
	-PCA
	-ZCA
	-LDA
	-PLS-DA

5. Bayesian inference
